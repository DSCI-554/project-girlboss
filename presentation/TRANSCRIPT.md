## Slide 1 (Introduction slide)
Hello, my name is Madeleine and my teammates Sarah, Erin, Erica and I are team #Girlboss. Our project is focusing on visualizing the gender gap in employment and education.

## Slide 2
As women in data science, my teammates and I wanted to dive into issues that are close to our hearts. Gender discrimination is an issue that has plagued modern economies, and although female participation in the workforce has been climbing, there are still many issues left to be addressed, especially outside of the US and in specific disciplines such as STEM.

## Slide 3
The goal of our project is to create an interactive infographic that allows users to explore data documenting the gender gap in employment and in education. We hope to create something that can be used by everyone curious about learning more about how this gender gap affects women across the world.

## Slide 4
Previous work include static visualizations and infographics - we wanted to expand on this previous work by not only expanding the scope but also the format and interactivity of our visualizations. We wanted to create something that the user can interact with in an exploratory way and view different data on the same topic.

## Slide 5
We took data from four different sources. Our data comes from well-vetted online repositories that call from government sources like the US Census or other government agencies. We have sources of both economic and educational data covering the United States and/or the world.

## Slide 6
Because we wanted our final product to be interactive and cohesive with the story we are trying to convey, we separated our visualizations onto two main pages in our website - one for education-related visualizations and one for employment-related visualizations.

## Slide 7
We implemented our website using Vue.js with Bootstrap templates and D3 and Mapbox charts and maps for our visualizations. We found that this was the most straightforward way to meet all of the requirements of the project while still maintaining the structure and aesthetics of our site.

## Slide 8
Each team member contributed to building the necessary visualizations for our website. Outside of our shared duties, Sarah built several charts for the education section of the site, Erin and Erica focused on building the website, and I finalized the paper and presentation.

## Slide 9
Here you can see several of the visualizations used in our app. We have a static reactive line chart, an interactive D3 map, and an interactive bubble chart. We made an effort to utilize all of the data that we had available and present it in several different formats.

## Slide 10
Overall, the website we built is a great tool for users to explore data documenting the gender gap. Other things that we would like to add to our site if we had more time to work on it would be more visualizations of data we have already collected and new data sources to explore.

## Slide 11
Thank you and we hope you enjoyed our presentation!
