We are Team Girlboss and our project is called Visualizing the Gender Gap in Employment and Education.

As women in STEM, my teammates and I wanted to dive into an issue that is important to us--gender equality. Although progress has been made in this area in recent decades, gender disparities continue to exist. In our project, we focus on gender differences in employment and education and on the creation of an interactive infographic that allows users to explore and understand trends of this issue.

First, we will go over the Employment page that starts with an overview of our topic. The first graph is a line chart that shows gender disparity in wages. It graphs the average female-to-male earning ratio from 1995 to 2011 and uses data from the No Ceilings dataset. The blue button below the chart will redirect you to the Explore page, where there are (stutter) additional charts that allows you to deep dive into wage gap data and learn more details. We will come back to this later.

The second chart is an animated choropleth map that shows the gender wage gap across the world from 2000 to 2019. The data comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. To look at how the gender wage gap has changed over time, you can click the start button to begin animating the map. There is also a drop down menu that allows you to change the indicator of the gender wage gap variable to look at median, top, or bottom earners.

The third graph is a circle packing layout graph. This chart shows the % of male and females employed in different job sectors where blue circles correspond to the % of males and the red circles correspond to the % of females. The  data comes from the No Ceilings dataset and the chart is interactive, so you can click on the job sector circles to take a closer look at the gender distribution of each sector for different countries.

The fourth graph is a Mapbox choropleth map that shows median annual income of women across the United States. The data comes from the IWPR Status of Women in the States dataset. The map is interactive where you can hover over a state to see the median annual earnings for women in the state in the tooltip on the top righthand corner.

Coming back to the blue button, if you click on it, you will be redirected to the Explore page where there is a responsive interactive line chart with animated transitions that shows monthly wages by gender over time. There is a drop down menu that allows you to select specific countries of interest to see wages differences over time for these select countries.

The next chart in the Explore page is a detailed, interactive version of the choropleth shown in the Employment page. There is a slider on the bottom of the map that allows you to change the year and hovering over a country in the map will bring up a tool tip that describes more information about the country at the specified year. There is also the dropdown that allows you to change wage gap indicator.

The last page of our infographic is the Education page. The first chart of the Education page includes an interactive bar chart that displays student enrollment by education level. You can click on pink or blue bars to see how many females and males make up student population. This will show up on the upper right corner. There is also a drop down that allows you to look at this information by specific country.

The second chart in the Education page is a line chart that shows the gender parity index in tertiary education over time. This chart also features a dropdown menu that allows you to choose specific countries to investigate.

The third graph is an interactive bubble chart that shows the % of women students in college majors and their median salary. The size of the bubble corresponds to the total population of males and females. You can click on a bubble to display the median salary of each field. This appears on top of the chart.

The fourth graph is an animated radial bar chart with interactive buttons. The overall chart shows the % of women in different majors. To take a closer look at specific majors, you can click on a button of the interested department and see the makeup of women in the majors in these departments.

That concludes the video walkthrough of our project. Thank you for watching.
